### 1. Which option do you plan to pursue? 
I am going to pursue the first option, which is the one I planned on doing since the start.

### 2. Reinstate your question(s). Has this changed at all since HW #1? How so? 
From working with the data I have boiled it down to understanding the differences between Sacramento county and Ventura County. I have past, present, and future data in one shape or form for both of these counties. I don't believe I have the best data as there is room for a lot of interpretation, but I can use each one to represent a figure on my visualization. I am interested in how different these two counties are given their geographic differences. A better comparison would be to directly measure between a more northern and more southern county, but these counties had the most data. 

### 3. Explain which variables from your data set(s) you will use to answer your question(s) and how
The variables of interest are as follows:

- `org_id`: An organizational ID that refers to a specific water agency
- `forecast_start_date`: Start date for projected data
- `supplier_name`: Name of the supplier 

These variables are present in each dataset. `supplier_name` and `org_id` will be used to identify the water agencies in Ventura and Sacramento counties. These will be paired with `forecast_start_date` to plot the respective values from each dataset onto a time series plot. 

The variables of interest within the past dataset (`historical_production`) are:

- `water_produced_or_delivered`: If the water is being produced or delivered 
- `water_type`: What type of facility the water is coming from or going to
- `quanitity_acre_feet`: In units acre-feet, the quanitity of water from each observation

These variables, along with the general variables, will be used to identify the differences of water type production/delivery between Sacramento and Ventura counties. 

The variables of interest with the present dataset (`water_shortage`) are:

- `state_standard_shortage_level`: A shortage level on a scale of 0 - 6 that tells us the water shortage state of each agency

This data is presented every month from 2022 to 2024. It will used to show trends in the counties water levels. 

The variables of interest with the projection dataset (`five_year_shortage`) are:

- `water_use_acre_feet`: projected water used for each agency   
- `water_supplies_acre_feet`: projected water supply for each agency
- `benefit_supply_augmentation_acre_feet`: projected supply augmentated (bought) for each agency
- `benefit_demand_reduction_acre_feet`: projected demand reduced for each agency

These variables are projections reported from individual water agencies during the 2020 Urban Water Management Plan submission. They are representative of the worst consecutive 5 years on average. Each row is an projected observation for years 2021 - 2025 because this data was submitted in 2020. 

### 4. Find at least two data visualizations 

![Visualization 1](hw3-photo1.jpg)

This is a great visualization. It really brings home the point that simpler can be better. It has some easy to read information and it drives the point home that there are many people out there that don't have safe drinking water. I think producing something along this line can be affective. Of course, I want to try and produce something with a little more pizzazz as the examples we have seen from class are great. 

![Visualization 2](hw3-photo2.png)

This is an interesting plot for time series data. makes it has a little more 

### 5. Draw anticapated visualizations

![Hand Drawn Visualizations](drawn-infographic.png)

### 6. Mock up visualizations using code

- have your data plotted (if youâ€™re experimenting with a graphic form(s) that was not explicitly covered in class, we understand that this may take some more time to build; you should have as much put together as possible)
- use appropriate strategies to highlight / focus attention on a clear message
- include appropriate text such as titles, captions, axis labels
- experiment with colors and typefaces / fonts
- create a presentable / aesthetically-pleasing theme (e.g. (re)move gridlines / legends as appropriate, adjust font sizes, etc.)
